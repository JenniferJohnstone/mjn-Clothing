##Please note 
This was collaborative project created over the period of a few weeks between 2 other students. 

## Main purpose of project:

The main purpose of our project is to provide an e-commerce platform for those who are interested in online shopping. Our web application is called MJN Clothing, which is made from our team member’s initials. In addition, creating an e-commerce platform would be challenging and enjoyable for us, so we tried to provide a variety of products for our potential customers with the modern design of website. 


## Target users:
The main target users for this web application are females aged between 19-35; however, it is assumed the users older than 35 years old might shop for gifts or their children. Therefore, we have targeted the young generation.


## Achieved component and Target Minimum Viable:
During three/four weeks’ time of the project we could achieve and impalement almost all components and features we expected at the beginning of the project. Hence, according to our milestones we implemented the login and register form for the customers to register or log in to the website and continue shopping for their profile. Moreover, our website has the view the product in a single page and adding to shopping card. Furthermore, the search bar on the top with the navigation bar have made the navigation easy for customers to find the product they have in their mind. Moreover, there is a fixed-on home button that help the users to go back to the home page and see the top products that is shown on the home page.   However, as it was expected we could not implement the payment system because our team includes only three team members and there have been many challenging features that were required to implement.

## project source code - where should we look for what you have done



## Our next steps would be if you were to continue the project
If we could continue working on the project, we focus on bringing a better API product that products quality and visual merchandises are superior and they more accord what we expected from our e-commerce website. Moreover, we would work on the payment methods that can be a challenging stage of our project.  

## Communication, interaction and contribution:
 Interaction and connection among of our team was very good and we could communicate and share our ideas very easily with each other. We communicated with each other through Facebook chat and we had few Zoom meetings as we needed. Moreover, we tried to help each other in the tasks that seemed difficult for us and all the team members were responsible and accessible for communication
